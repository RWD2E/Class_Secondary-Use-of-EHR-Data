# Secondary Use of EHR Data

This course is tailored towards Master of Health Informatics but could be of interests to all other students as well (MS in Data Science, IDSI PhD, Health Professions, Nursing, Biostatistics, Inter-disciplinary PhD with emphasis on informatics). It introduces students to biomedical informatics and secondary analysis of electronic health records, clinical and administrative information systems and workflows, data warehousing, hypothesis generation and data collection using popular graphic user interface (GUI) tools and Structured Query Language (SQL), developing a computable phenotypes and research cohorts for observational research or prospective trial eligibility, as well as performing analysis using statistical and machine learning models deployed on real-world-health-data (RWHD) centered on electronic health records (EHR) in R programming. Students will gain hands-on experience through the entire informatics-driven study pipeline: from defining research questions, discovering study cohort, collecting and processing study samples using RWHD; to creating an analytic-ready dataset and conducting analysis using our AWS cloud-based analytic workbench; until finally preparing an abstract for submission to a clinical or informatics forum/conference.


## Course Goals / Objectives:
1. Identify secondary data sources available for observational and prospective clinical research
2. Develop a basic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various source systems and underlying clinical workflows generating secondary data for clinical research
3. Demonstrate competent use of informatics methods for hypotheses generation, computable phenotyping, data management, and analytic dataset preparation
4. Design an observational study or cohort for a prospective trial, create an analytic dataset, and complete preliminary analysis
5. Be able to select appropriate statistical or machine learning technics on RWHD to address healthcare problems in one of the three settings (case-control, cohort study, cross-sectional study)
6. Understand the concepts and importance of model overfitting, model bias and interpretability and common methods to address relevant issues
