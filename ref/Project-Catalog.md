# Neuromuscular Diseases
Neuromuscular diseases encompass a broad range of disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system, including conditions like muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and myasthenia gravis. These diseases can lead to muscle weakness, atrophy, and impaired motor function due to the degeneration of motor neurons or muscle fibers. The etiology of many neuromuscular diseases is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and autoimmune factors. Despite advancements in understanding the genetic basis of neuromuscular diseases, there remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding the natural history of these conditions and their long-term outcomes in diverse populations. 


# Obesity
Obesity is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation, which can adversely affect health. It is commonly defined using the Body Mass Index (BMI), where a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of various chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Factors contributing to obesity include genetics, metabolism, environment, behavior, and socio-economic status. While there is a wealth of research on the clinical implications of obesity, there is a notable gap in understanding its long-term impacts on diverse populations, particularly in relation to various treatment modalities. 


# Type 2 Diebetes Mellitus
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. It is often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and a sedentary lifestyle. T2DM can result in serious complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The condition has significant implications for public health, given its rising prevalence worldwide. Although there is extensive research on the pathophysiology and management of T2DM, gaps remain in understanding the long-term effectiveness of various treatment strategies in real-world settings, particularly concerning diverse populations of different socio-economic status. 


# Hypertension
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic condition defined by consistently elevated blood pressure levels, typically above 130/80 mmHg. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, kidney failure, and other serious health issues. Hypertension can be classified as primary (essential), with no identifiable cause, or secondary, resulting from underlying health conditions. Lifestyle factors, genetics, and environmental influences play significant roles in its development and management. Despite extensive knowledge about hypertension's risk factors and treatment options, there is a significant gap in understanding how real-world factors impact hypertension management and long-term outcomes.


# Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of breast cells. It is the most common cancer among women globally and can occur in both men and women, although it is significantly rarer in men. Risk factors include genetics (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations), age, family history, hormonal factors, and lifestyle choices. Breast cancer can manifest in various forms, and treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy. While there is extensive research on breast cancer prevention and treatment, there remains a gap in understanding how real-world factors, including socio-economic status, access to care, and patient demographics, influence treatment outcomes and survivorship.


# Traumatic Brain Injury
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by an external force, such as a blow to the head or a penetrating injury. TBIs can range from mild concussions to severe brain injuries resulting in long-term disability or death. Symptoms can vary widely and may include cognitive impairments, emotional disturbances, physical disabilities, and changes in behavior. The incidence of TBI is particularly high among specific populations, such as athletes, military personnel, and the elderly. Despite advances in acute care and rehabilitation for TBI, significant gaps remain in understanding the long-term outcomes and factors influencing recovery.


# Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep patterns and decreased oxygen levels in the blood. This condition can result in excessive daytime sleepiness, cardiovascular problems, metabolic disorders, and other health complications. Risk factors include obesity, age, gender (more common in males), and anatomical abnormalities of the airway. While there is considerable research on the clinical aspects and treatment of OSA, gaps exist in understanding the long-term effects of OSA treatment in diverse populations and the influence of socio-economic factors on diagnosis and management.


# Maternal Mortality and Morbidity
Maternal mortality and morbidity refer to the deaths and health complications that occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or within the postpartum period. Maternal mortality is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy due to complications related to the pregnancy or its management. Maternal morbidity encompasses a range of health issues that can arise during or after pregnancy, including severe pregnancy-related complications, mental health disorders, and chronic conditions exacerbated by pregnancy. Despite global efforts to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, significant gaps remain in understanding the underlying causes and risk factors, particularly in specific populations.


# Depression
Depression is a common and serious mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and a range of emotional and physical problems. It can affect how individuals think, feel, and handle daily activities. Symptoms may include changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Depression can arise from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. While there is substantial research on the clinical aspects of depression, gaps still exist in understanding the optimal choice of first-line treatments, long-term outcomes of treatment, factors explaining variations in treatment adherence and effectiveness. 


# Substance Use Disorder
Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a complex condition characterized by an individual's inability to control or stop using substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescription medications, despite harmful consequences. SUD can lead to significant health, social, and economic issues, including physical and mental health problems, impaired functioning, and increased risk of overdose. Although there has been considerable research on the treatment and prevention of SUD, gaps remain in understanding the long-term outcomes of various treatment approaches, treatment adherence, and the effects of co-occurring mental health disorders on recovery.


# Geriatric Frailty
Geriatric frailty is a syndrome characterized by a decline in physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors, leading to a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, such as falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality among older adults. It is often identified through a combination of clinical signs, including unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity levels. Frailty is influenced by multiple factors, including age, chronic diseases, and social determinants of health. Despite growing awareness of geriatric frailty, there are significant gaps in understanding its prevalence, underlying mechanisms, and effective management approaches in diverse population, especially those with multi-morbidities. 


# Advanced Kidney Diseases (CKD, AKI, KTT)
Advanced kidney diseases encompass a spectrum of conditions affecting kidney function, including Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and the subsequent need for kidney transplantation. AKI is characterized by a sudden decline in kidney function, often reversible with prompt intervention, while CKD involves a gradual loss of kidney function over time, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Kidney transplantation is a treatment option for ESRD, providing improved quality of life and survival compared to dialysis. Despite advancements in understanding and managing kidney diseases, significant gaps remain in the comprehension of disease progression, the interplay between AKI and CKD, and the long-term outcomes following kidney transplantation. 


# Contextual Determinants of Health
Contextual determinants of health refer to the broad range of factors that influence health outcomes beyond individual biology and behavior. These determinants include social, economic, environmental, and cultural factors that shape health disparities and access to healthcare services. While there is growing recognition of the role of contextual determinants in health, significant gaps exist in quantifying their impact on specific health outcomes, access to care, treatment adherence and responses in various populations.
